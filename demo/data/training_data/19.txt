meta	experience	Good, classy organization. I sold about 6-8 vehicles per month at a Volvo dealership that sold about 35 per month between three salespeople. I left simply because Volvo is now sending most of it's new vehicles to China, which is really aggravating U.S. dealers in general. There was nowhere else to go at Century so I left and have been selling credit card processing B2B since March. Thank you.~
