meta	experience	I did cashiering while also being the front end supervisor. I also worked in the fitting room, organizing clothes on the rack and making sure the area was secured from theft. I did some security in the store and I had to greet customers as they came in. I worked on the sales floor, restored the store, and made sure it looked the way it did when we opened.
